I find myself more interested in emergency preparedness these days.
But it seems like there's quite a bit of misinformation out there on the
net. Most of it seems to be geared towards selling novelties and fantasy,
ie. the most important thing you need to survive is a sawed off shotgun.
Maybe in a zombie movie. If fantasy is your thing then go nuts, as long as
it doesn't affect me. I just hope these people know that it's a fantasy.

Yesterday I read a blog about a "bug-out bag" where the author stated that
you didn't really need to carry water. Bullshit. For the past 100 years
_all_ standard military carrying gear has included the capability of
carrying exactly two things: ammunition and water. This is because water is
literally the most important thing you can carry for survival.

The other thing about these bug out bags is that they're way too large.
